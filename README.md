# KeyCast Lower Thirds

KeyCast Lower Thirds is an Electron + React control surface for driving broadcast-quality lower thirds with chroma or alpha workflows. It ships with an operator-friendly panel, a kiosk-ready HDMI output, and real-time sync between the two so you can focus on live production instead of fighting graphics software.

> **Why ‚ÄúKeyCast‚Äù?**  
> The app is designed to drop straight into OBS, vMix, ATEM, or any SDI/NDI pipeline‚Äîeither as a keyed fill over a chroma background or as a stand-alone HDMI feed.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Dual-window architecture**: control UI on your desktop, fullscreen kiosk output on a designated monitor/HDMI port.
- **Instant updates**: text, colors, placement, visibility, and animated logos sync live‚Äîno reloads.
- **Chroma-ready background**: choose any key color (default neon green) for OBS/ATEM chroma workflows.
- **Output manager**: start/stop the kiosk window from the control panel and lock it to any detected display.
- **Flexible lower thirds**: switch between text banners and video clips, with optional loop control, without leaving the tab.
- **Animated logos**: loop or play-once alpha video (WebM/MP4/MOV) or transparent GIF/APNG overlays with positional controls.
- **Quick styling presets**: one-click News, Event, and Alert palettes to keep operators moving fast.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Launch Vite + Electron in dev mode
npm run dev
```

The first window that appears is the **control panel**. Once you‚Äôre ready to output, open the **System ‚Üí Output Control** tab and hit **Start Output**. The kiosk window will jump to the configured display and run in frameless, locked-down mode.

For production builds:

```bash
npm run package
```

Artifacts are generated via `electron-builder` inside `dist/`.

## üîß Configuration Cheatsheet

### Lower Third Tab

- **Content type**: choose between a text-driven banner or a muted video clip.
- **Loop clip**: decide whether a selected video lower third repeats or runs once.
- **Primary / Secondary title**: supports emoji, RTL text, and quick clear.
- **Background colors**: per-line color pickers with hex entry; updates push straight to the output surface.
- **Placement**: top/bottom + left/right corners with animated transitions.
- **Logo video playback**: when a video logo is loaded, choose loop vs play-once directly from here.
- **Visibility toggle**: instantly fade lower third in/out without killing the kiosk.
- **Quick themes**: apply curated color sets for News, Event, and Alert packages.

### Logo Tab

- **Accepted formats**: GIF, APNG, transparent PNG, WebM/MP4/MOV (muted by default).
- **Positioning**: all four corners; snapping to safe margins.
- **Show/Hide toggle**: operate independently of the text overlay.
- **Live preview**: scaled frame inside the control panel plus real kiosk render.

### System Tab

- **Key color**: pick the chroma background (defaults to `#00FF00`).  
  - For OBS, add a Window Capture ‚Üí Chroma Key filter.  
  - For ATEM, feed the fill output and key out the chroma value, or use OBS/vMix as an upstream keyer.
- **Display routing**: target any connected monitor/HDMI/SDI adapter.
- **Output control**: start/stop the kiosk window, monitor status via pill indicator.

## üéõÔ∏è OBS / ATEM Integration Tips

### OBS Studio

1. `Start Output` inside KeyCast.
2. Add a **Window Capture** (or **Game Capture**) source targeting the kiosk window.
3. Apply a **Chroma Key** filter using the configured background color.
4. Layer above your camera input and lock placement.

For alpha workflows, you can embed the Vite dev server as a **Browser Source** (when packaged, serve the production build) and set `backgroundColor` to transparent instead of green. That requires a bit of customization‚Äîsee ‚ÄúExtending‚Äù below.

### Blackmagic ATEM (Mini / Television Studio)

- If your capture card supports fill/key pairs, run KeyCast full-screen on a machine feeding both signals.
- Otherwise, key the chroma background using the upstream keyer; adjust the **clip** and **gain** to match your chosen color.
- Use the System tab to flip between auditorium screens, lobby signage, or dedicated keyer inputs.

## üß© Extending

| Area | Description | Hint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha Output | Render transparency instead of chroma fill. | Swap the kiosk background to transparent canvas and export via NDI/RTMP or Browser Source. |
| Themes | Add more quick presets for specific shows. | Update `presetThemes` in `ControlPanel.jsx`. |
| Shortcuts | Hook up Stream Deck / X-Keys triggers. | Wire to IPC events (`lowerThird:update`, `output:start`, etc.). |
| Automation | Drive from rundown or REST API. | Inject via `ipcMain.on("lowerThird:update")` or expose HTTP endpoints. |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Electron 31** powers the dual-window orchestration and IPC bridge.
- **React 18 + Vite 5** render the control panel and kiosk UI.
- **IPC messaging** keeps control ‚Üí kiosk state synchronized in real time.
- **Context-isolated preload** restricts the renderer to safe, typed APIs.
- **Chroma workflow** uses standard HTML color input; all styling is pure CSS for easy theming.

- Custom font upload & font weight control.
- Timeline-based lower third playlists.
- Companion HTTP/OSC control layer.
- Automated mirror to web overlays for remote shows.

## Creator‚Äôs Note

This project started because I wanted to study how Japanese TV shows craft their animated overlays and how conferences layer live cameras, presentations, and titles together. KeyCast Lower Thirds is my sandbox for learning those broadcast techniques while building something others can use on their own productions. :)
